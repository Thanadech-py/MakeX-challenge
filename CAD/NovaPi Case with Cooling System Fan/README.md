<h1>NovaPi</h1>
The NovaPi is the main microcontroller that is use in MakeX Challenge Robotics Competition and also it came with the NovaPi Expansion board that we can connect the DC motor 12V 
so that we can control the actuators of the robot.
<h1>NovaPi Case</h1>
The NovaPi are sensitive to the conductive material such as copper, iron, gold, aluminum, and silver, so NovaPi Case is important to protect the NovaPi board.
<h1>Heat Problem</h1>
This sesson of MakeX Challenge Robotics Competition we face the problem that cause the NovaPi Expansion board the be broke and we see that the ATM Chip of the board is geting very hot.
So we design the new NovaPi Case that we can install the Brushless DC Fan to the case so that the fan can prevent the board the ve overheating.
